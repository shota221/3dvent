        1. Using this application, read the GS-1 code of the MicroVent®V3 and enter the basic patient information: body length,body weight,gender and patient ID.

    </p>
    <p>
        2. The application will then display the standard recommended tidal volume required for the patient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Next, remove the MicroVent®V3 from the test lung and connect it to the patient's tracheal tube. At this point,if you have no experience of using this device, enter the default settings of 20 cmH₂O set pressure dial, 9 L/min air flow and 3 L/min oxygen flow. (If you have used this device before, you can select the default values by guessing the patient's condition)
    </p>
    <p>
        4.If the respiratory rate is too fast,increase the pressure setting in increments of +2.5 cmH₂O (＜40cmH₂O). If too slow, reduce the pressure setting in -2.5cmH₂O increments (＞8cmH₂O). <br>
        If the SpO₂ is less than 92%, increase the oxygen flow and decrease the air flow so that the total flow is 12 L/min.

    <p>
        5. Re-enter that setting, the air flow rate and the oxygen flow rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. FiO₂ and estimated PEEP will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. Check the boxes for both normal respiratory rate and SpO₂ ＞ 92%
    </p>
    <p>
        8. Now proceed to the device sound acquisition to estimate actual Vt,VM.
    </p>
    <p>
        9. Register the estimated values of Vt and VM.

        1. If the estimated MV is too high and the respiratory rate is too high, reduce the total flow by 3 L/min. Then, adjust the proportion of oxygen and air flow not to change the FiO₂ at this time.

        2. If the estimated MV is low or the respiratory rate is too low, increase the total flow by 3 L/min. Then, adjust the proportion of oxygen and air flow not to change the FiO₂ at this time.

    <p>
        3. If the FiO₂ is above 50%, to maintain SpO₂＞92%, increase the air flow only and increase the total flow to increase the estimated MV and at the same time decrease the FiO₂. If the respiratory rate is too high, increase the Pressure Dial setting.
